"The Myanmar Agricultural Performance Survey (MAPS) is a nationwide phone panel consisting of approximately 5,500 households. The objective of the survey is to collect data on farm characteristics and agricultural assets, area and crops planted, access to inputs, crop marketing, and constraints in agricultural activities. The respondents interviewed are a sub-sample of the Myanmar Household Welfare Survey. A novel sampling strategy in combination with the development of household and population weights allows for estimates that are nationally, regionally, and urban/rural representative. MAPS Round 3 survey was implemented by phone by Myanmar Survey Research (MSR) over the period January 23rd until February 22nd, 2023. Almost 5,000 farmers (4,961) that were interviewed in the fourth round of the MHWS could be reached for a second follow-up interview."
