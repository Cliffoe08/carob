"Grain yield, biomass, and nutritional values of various cropping systems tested on-station with/without fertilizer application on two soils in Zimbabwe between 2020 and 2023
  
This database contains data on grain, biomass, protein, and calorie yields from on-station trials in Zimbabwe, conducted at the Domboshava Training Centre (DTC) (17.62째S, 31.17째E) and the University of Zimbabwe farm (UZ) (17.73째S, 31.020째E), characterized by different soil types.

The trials tested maize monocropping, maize-legume rotations, and intercropping with various layouts (traditional intercropping and double-row strip cropping), with and without fertilizer application. Two contrasting legumes, cowpea and pigeon pea, were included in the cropping systems. The experiment was established during the 2019/2020 growing season, but data were collected from the 2020/21 to 2022/23 seasons to allow the rotations to develop. It was carried out under Conservation Agriculture and rainfed conditions.

The dataset is divided into three parts:
1) Field measurement, including treatments, grain yields, and crop biomass;
2) Calculations at the cropping system level (total biomass, calories, and proteins);
3) Processed data used to evaluate the stability of each cropping system, as shown in a radar plot presented in the related paper."
