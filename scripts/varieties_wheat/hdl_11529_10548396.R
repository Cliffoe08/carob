"Within the framework of SATYN, two types of nurseries are produced: SATYN series with odd numbers are lines for drought-stressed areas, and SATYN series with even numbers are lines for heat stress conditions. These nurseries have been phenotyped in the major wheat-growing mega environments through the International Wheat Improvement Network (IWIN) and the Cereal System Initiative for South Asia (CSISA) network, which included a total of 136 environments (site-year combinations) in major spring wheat-growing countries such as Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Mexico, Nepal, and Pakistan.
