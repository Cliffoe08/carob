"The Mother and Baby (M&B) trial methodology was adapted by CIP for Participatory Variety Selection (PVS) through decentralized evaluation networks and multi-year evaluations in potato growing areas in the Andean region. The M&B trial design encourages active participation of farmers through the application of treatments through systematic evaluations and selections of treatments in their own plots called \"Baby trials\" (i.e. farmer managed trials) and in fields with an experimental design called \"Mother trials\" (i.e. researcher managed trials).Objective: Analyze characteristics, attributes and preferences that men and women have when selecting a new potato variety at the phase of flowering and harvesting.A M&B trial was performed to evaluate 5 clones with late blight resistance in the localities of 3 de Diciembre in the province of Chupaca, and the locality of Paca in the province of Jauja, in Junin department, Peru. The trial design was a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 3 replicates for Mother trials and 3 replicates during the period 2013-2014. Total number of participants at flowering phase was 9 (men=2 and women=7) in the locality of 3 de Diciembre, and 12 (men=5, women =7) in the locality of Paca. Total number of participants at harvesting phase was 9 (men=2 and women=7) in the locality of 3 de Diciembre, and 12 (men=5, women =7) in the locality of Paca. Additionally, an organoleptic evaluation was assessed at harvesting to evaluate appearance, taste and texture. The number of panelists was 12 (men=4, women=8) and 24 (men=13, women=11) for both localities respectively."
