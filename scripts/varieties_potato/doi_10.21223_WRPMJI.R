"Field book for the LBHT x LTVR clones yield evaluation in 2018 growing season at Holetta, Ethiopia. The dataset includes data about 72 potato clones. The experiment was created with an Alpha-lattice design (9*8), with 2 replication, over a 16x32 m area. The plants were fertilized with NPS (237 kg/ha) and urea (143 Kg/ha). Each plot contains 1 row, for a total of 10 plants. Row length is 3 m, spaced 0.75 m between rows and 0.3 m within rows."
