"Group B1, cycle B1C5 of Population B (fifth cycle of recombination of the pure native Andigena group B1), is the result of a new population improvement strategy in the absence of R- genes started at CIP in 1990. The group B1 derives of primitive cultivars of Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigena, known to be free of R- genes.  These clones were planted in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 2-4 replicates at La Victoria, Huancayo, Junin-Peru, located at 3290 masl."
