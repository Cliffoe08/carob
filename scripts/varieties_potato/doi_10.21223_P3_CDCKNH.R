"The Mother and Baby (M&B) trial methodology was adapted by CIP for Participatory Variety Selection (PVS) through decentralized evaluation networks and multi-year evaluations in potato growing areas in the Andean region. The M&B trial design encourages active participation of farmers through the application of treatments through systematic evaluations and selections of treatments in their own plots called \"Baby trials\" (i.e. farmer managed trials) and in fields with an experimental design called \"Mother trials\" (i.e. researcher managed trials).Objective: Analyze characteristics, attributes and preferences that men and women have when selecting a new potato variety at the phase of flowering and harvesting.A M&B trial was performed to evaluate 5 clones with frost tolerant at the localities of Macullida and San Juan Bajo in Sanchez Carrion province, in La Libertad department, Peru. The trial design was a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 3 replicates for Mother trials and 3 replicates during 2013-2014.In this experiment characteristics of plant (size, type of foliage), yield, quality, and pest and disease resistance during flowering and harvesting were evaluated.The number of participants at flowering phase was 11 (men=7 and women=4) and 81 (men=14, women = 67) in the localities of Macullida and San Juan Bajo respectively. The number of participants at harvesting phase was 20 (men=6 and women=14) and 22 (men=12, women =10) in the localities of Macullida and San Juan Bajo respectively.  Additionally, an organoleptic evaluation was assessed at harvesting to evaluate appearance, taste and texture. The number of panelists was 13 (men=8, women=5), 10 (men=5, women=5) in the localities of Macullida and San Juan Bajo respectively."
